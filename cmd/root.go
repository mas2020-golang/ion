The swiss knife for every SysAdmin/DevOps!. You can use the ion commands as you do with pipes,
standard input/output and a lot of other daily basis activities.

Some examples:
// to search some content into a file
$ ion search --regexp '(temp)' --color test.txt

// tail the last 10 rows
$ ion tail --rows 10 test.txt

	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
