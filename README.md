# ion
Ion is a all-in-one application to sum up a lot of useful tools in a single command. The swiss knife for every SysAdmin/DevOps!

## Principles

The principles of `ion` is to be light, simple and easy to use. The documentation is contained in the application itself
that be can read as you do with other modern CLI tools as docker, kubernetes, hugo. Simply type:

```shell
ion --help
```

or for a specific command help type:

```shell
ion <command> --help
```

> Note
Some commands, for a more comfortable use have the same name of the corresponding linux/unix command. It doesn't mean that have
the same options or the same complexity. `ion` is born to be light and easy to use, for specific and complex use cases take a look at the
Linux/Unix commands.
